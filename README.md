# 🚗 Vehicle Price Prediction using Machine Learning (MLP Regressor)

This project predicts the selling price of a vehicle using a fully connected neural network model implemented with **MLPRegressor** from Scikit-Learn. The model is trained on key vehicle attributes like mileage, year, fuel type, transmission, and engine specifications. A Streamlit web app is included for real-time predictions.
